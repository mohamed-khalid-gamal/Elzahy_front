# Scroll Restoration Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the issue where navigating to components caused the page to start at the bottom instead of scrolling to the top.

## Changes Made

### 1. Router Configuration (app.config.ts)
- Added `withInMemoryScrolling` import from `@angular/router`
- Configured router with scroll restoration settings:
  - `scrollPositionRestoration: 'top'` - Always scroll to top on navigation
  - `anchorScrolling: 'enabled'` - Enable anchor-based navigation support

### 2. Scroll Service (services/scroll.service.ts)
- Created a dedicated scroll service to handle scroll behavior
- Features:
  - Automatic scroll to top on route navigation
  - Manual scroll to top method
  - Scroll to specific element by ID
  - Scroll to specific position with smooth animation

### 3. App Component (app.component.ts)
- Injected ScrollService to initialize scroll behavior
- Service automatically subscribes to router events and manages scroll position

## How It Works

1. **Router Level**: The router configuration ensures that whenever a route changes, the scroll position is automatically reset to the top of the page.

2. **Service Level**: The ScrollService provides additional scroll control and listens to router events to ensure consistent scroll behavior across all navigation.

3. **Component Level**: The app component initializes the scroll service, which sets up the navigation listeners.

## Usage

The scroll restoration now works automatically for all route navigation. No additional code is needed in individual components.

### Manual Scroll Control (Optional)
If you need manual scroll control in any component, you can inject the ScrollService:

```typescript
import { ScrollService } from '../services/scroll.service';

@Component({...})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private scrollService: ScrollService) {}

  scrollToTop() {
    this.scrollService.scrollToTop();
  }

  scrollToElement(elementId: string) {
    this.scrollService.scrollToElement(elementId);
  }
}
```

## Result
- All route navigation now starts from the top of the page
- Smooth scrolling behavior is maintained
- Additional scroll utilities are available for custom requirements
