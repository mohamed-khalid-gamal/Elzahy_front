# API Endpoint Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
You were getting a 404 error for the endpoint `/api/Projects/public/2`, but according to your API documentation, there is **no** `/public/` endpoint in the Projects API.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the proxy configuration file (`proxy.conf.json`) which was pointing to the wrong API server:
- **Before**: `http://elzahytest.runasp.net`
- **After**: `https://elzahygroupback.premiumasp.net`

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Proxy Configuration
**File**: `proxy.conf.json`
```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "https://elzahygroupback.premiumasp.net",
    "secure": true,
    "changeOrigin": true,
    "logLevel": "debug"
  }
}
```

### 2. Verified Environment Configuration
**File**: `src/environments/environment.ts`
- Kept `apiBaseUrl: '/api'` (relative path) to work with proxy
- Production environment already had correct URL: `https://elzahygroupback.premiumasp.net/api`

### 3. Verified Projects Service
**File**: `src/app/services/projects.service.ts`
- All endpoints are correctly implemented according to API documentation
- `getPublicProject()` method correctly calls `/api/Projects/{id}` (not `/api/Projects/public/{id}`)

## Correct API Endpoints (as per your API documentation)

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/Projects` - Get projects with filtering
- `GET /api/Projects/{id}` - Get single project
- `GET /api/Projects/summary` - Get projects summary
- `GET /api/Projects/featured` - Get featured projects
- `GET /api/Projects/by-status/{status}` - Get projects by status
- `GET /api/Projects/search` - Search projects
- `GET /api/Projects/by-property-type/{propertyType}` - Get by property type
- `GET /api/Projects/by-location/{location}` - Get by location
- `GET /api/Projects/images/{imageId}` - Get project image
- `GET /api/Projects/videos/{videoId}` - Get project video

### Admin Endpoints (require authentication)
- `POST /api/Projects` - Create project
- `PUT /api/Projects/{id}` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/Projects/{id}` - Delete project
- `PUT /api/Projects/{id}/toggle-featured` - Toggle featured status
- Various image/video management endpoints

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Updated proxy configuration to point to correct API server
2. ✅ Cleared Angular build cache
3. ✅ Restarted development server
4. ✅ Verified all service methods use correct endpoints

## Next Steps
1. **Clear browser cache** and do a hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Test the application** - the 404 errors should now be resolved
3. **Monitor browser network tab** to verify requests are going to correct URLs

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- API calls should now go to: `https://elzahygroupback.premiumasp.net/api/Projects/{id}`
- No more 404 errors for `/public/` endpoints
- Project details should load correctly
- All CRUD operations should work properly

## Note
If you still see 404 errors after these changes:
1. Ensure the API server at `https://elzahygroupback.premiumasp.net` is running
2. Check if the specific project ID exists in the database
3. Verify CORS settings on the API server allow requests from your Angular app
