# Image Gallery Layout Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Overlapping Text and Image Gallery**
**Problem**: The project title and description were overlapping with the image gallery due to absolute positioning.

**Solution**: 
- Separated the layout for single images vs multiple images
- For single images: Keep the overlay text (traditional design)
- For multiple images: Move the project info to a separate section below the gallery
- This prevents any overlap while maintaining a clean design

### 2. **Image Gallery Improvements**

**Enhanced Features**:
- ✅ **Better Visual Design**: Larger thumbnails (20x20 → w-20 h-20), improved spacing
- ✅ **Navigation Arrows**: Added left/right arrow buttons on the main image
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys now work to navigate between images
- ✅ **Selected State**: Clear visual indication of which thumbnail is currently selected
- ✅ **Gallery Header**: Shows total image count and current position
- ✅ **Improved Accessibility**: Better focus states and screen reader support

**Visual Enhancements**:
- Larger main image display (h-64 md:h-80 lg:h-96)
- Better contrast for thumbnails and controls
- Smoother animations and hover effects
- Selected image overlay with blue highlight
- Professional gallery counter display

### 3. **Layout Structure**

**Before (Problematic)**:
```html
<div class="relative">
  <div class="gallery">...</div>
  <div class="absolute overlay">
    <h1>Title overlapping gallery</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```html
<!-- Single Image -->
<div *ngIf="!hasMultipleImages()" class="relative">
  <img />
  <div class="absolute overlay">
    <h1>Title over single image</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Multiple Images -->
<div *ngIf="hasMultipleImages()">
  <app-image-gallery />
  <div class="separate-section">
    <h1>Title below gallery</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **ProjectDetailsPageComponent Template**
- Split hero section into two conditional layouts
- Single image: Traditional overlay design
- Multiple images: Gallery + separate info section
- Added proper spacing and styling

### 2. **ImageGalleryComponent Enhancements**
- Added navigation arrows with hover effects
- Implemented keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Improved thumbnail design with selection indicators
- Added gallery information header
- Better responsive design

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Navigation**: Click thumbnails, use arrows, or keyboard
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected image
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard support
- **Responsive**: Works well on all screen sizes

## Usage Example

The image gallery now works seamlessly:

```typescript
// Component automatically detects single vs multiple images
hasMultipleImages(project: ProjectDto): boolean {
  return project.images ? project.images.length > 1 : false;
}

// Enhanced image URL handling with priority system
getProjectImageUrl(project: ProjectDto): string {
  // 1. Try main image from new structure
  if (project.mainImage?.imageData) { ... }
  // 2. Try first image from images array
  if (project.images?.length > 0) { ... }
  // 3. Fall back to legacy properties
  // 4. Use placeholder
}
```

## Result

✅ **No more overlapping text**  
✅ **Professional image gallery with navigation**  
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained**  
✅ **Enhanced user experience**  
✅ **Responsive design**  
✅ **Keyboard accessibility**  

The layout now properly separates concerns:
- Single images get the traditional overlay design
- Multiple images get a dedicated gallery with separate info section
- Both approaches look professional and work seamlessly
